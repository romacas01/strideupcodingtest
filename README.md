NPS StrideUp
***

This is a very simple application that retrieves the information about parks from the National Park Service

How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?

I decided to build the application on SpringBoot, because it is the JAVA framework I am most familiar with, also is is very easy to set up.
I also decided to use Spring Data JPA on the repository layer since it is very simple and reduces the amount of boilerplate code that needs to be written by just implementing the interface

Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

I would better refactor the controller by eliminating some duplicated code. I would also increment the testing coverage.

What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

In addition to the improvements mentioned above, I would improve the DB design.
